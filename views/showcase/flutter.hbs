						<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herokuapp.backend.another&hl=es">The Vocabulary Builder</a> is one of the easiest ways to improve your Spanish or English. This app was built with Flutter using the Dart programming language and the BloC pattern. The app's content is powered by a <a href="server.html">server</a> built with Node.js and Express.js. The app helps users grow their vocabulary by showing them words in different sections, such as adverbs, verbs, adjectives, nouns, and idioms. The Vocabulary Builder contains a few features that enhance the user experience. Users can save words and access them offline and search words. Words contain definitions, gifts, examples, synonyms, and antonyms. If the word is a verb, it shows the conjugation.</p>
						<p>What makes unique The Vocabulary Builder is that it shows to the user words that are not basic, but words that every English or Spanish speaker should know. For example, scarecrow, bribe, trample, mirage, decoy, herd, curfew, trek, just to mention a few.  Unlike a dictionary app, which has words that the user would seldom use, The Vocabulary Builder contains handy words for English or Spanish learners.</p>
